# TU-Mobile-App
We aim to build a mobile application that connects TU students for the purpose of friendship, mentorship, and study buddies. This application will have the option to connect you with others within your major and course schedule, or with students from all different backgrounds, majors, and experiences.The app would focus on incentivizing in-person meetings as opposed to the traditional social media experience. In addition, the app will be used to develop friendships between students with similar interests, and set up meetings for tutoring or scheduling assistance. This application will also allow you to connect with students of different majors
